# .dotfiles ðŸ—ƒ  repo

- Replacement of the main [dotfiles](https://github.com/iAmG-r00t/dotfiles) repository.
- Basically I will start building this repository bit by bit.

- Simple server set-up script.
  - Installs several tools; `fzf`, `bat`, `tmux` and `mosh`.
  - Setups tmux and bash configuration files.
  - Does some few cleanups.

```sh
# Run this command to install.
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iAmG-r00t/.dotfiles/main/servers.sh | sh
```
