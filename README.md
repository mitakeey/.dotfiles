# .dotfiles üóÉ  repo

- Replacement of the main [dotfiles](https://github.com/iAmG-r00t/dotfiles) repository.
- Basically I will start building this repository bit by bit.

## Basic Vanilla Bash and VIM setup. üçΩ

- Simple basic server set-up script.
  - Installs several tools; `fzf`, `bat`, `tmux` and `mosh`.
  - Setups tmux and bash configuration files.
  - Does some few cleanups.

- Run this command to install and setup up basic vanilla setup that I mainly use in new server setups.

  ```sh
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iAmG-r00t/.dotfiles/main/servers.sh | bash
  ```
- Run this command to setup basic vanilla vim setup.

  ```sh
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iAmG-r00t/.dotfiles/main/vim.sh | bash
  ```
